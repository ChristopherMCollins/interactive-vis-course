## Project Grading

Project is 40% of the course grade total.

Here is the breakdown:

* 10% on text: connective text holding the story together, intro and conclusion, annotations, good explanations
* 10% on graph/chart elements: Good labeling of values/axes, tooltips, readability of chart contents
* 10% on visual style in charts/body: color schemes, attractiveness, clarity in graphs
* 10% on storytelling: You create a useful, interesting data narrative
* 20% for using 4 chart types we covered in class (can include small multiples as one)
* 20% for good interactivity: transitions, highlights, tooltips, filter/sort, animation...
* 10% for good data analysis: interesting findings/results, nice use of top 10s, etc.
* 10% for page layout/design: good visual and functional CSS, useful external links, resume/CV link, header/footer with info about the project and data as needed

Extra-extra credit options include:

## Project Grading

Project is 40% of the course grade total (base points, not the extra credit points). That comes to 495 points.

Here is the breakdown:

* 20% for using 4 chart types we covered in class (can include small multiples as one)
* 20% for good interactivity: Transitions, highlights, tooltips, filter/sort, animation...
* 15% on text: Connective text holding the story together, intro and conclusion, annotations on graphs, good explanations, good writing (good English style)
* 10% on storytelling: You create a useful, interesting data story flow using a mix of text, steppers/buttons, highlights, scrollytelling. (You don't have to use all of them.)
* 10% on graph/chart elements: Good labeling of values/axes, tooltips, readability of chart contents and labels
* 10% on visual style overall: Color scheme, attractiveness, clarity in graphs, use of UNICEF style somewhere in page
* 10% for good data analysis: Interesting findings/results, nice use of top 10s, relating data sets to each other intelligently
* 5% for page layout/design: Good visual and functional CSS, useful external links, resume/CV link, header/footer with info about the project and data as needed.

Extra-extra credit options will include:

* Well-structured, clean looking code (consider linting!)
* Use of outside data to supplement UNICEF data (because this is hard work)
* Using interesting/new interactions or graph types we didn't cover in class (including layouts below)
* Anything else that makes it stand out as a great project (my perogative, and class feedback during demos)


## Helpful Stuff (I Hope)

## JS Switch Statements as Function Lookups

Convert a JS Switch to a Function Lookup: http://www.nikola-breznjak.com/blog/javascript/converting-a-javascript-switch-statement-into-a-function-lookup/

Being more Functional (Same approach): http://encosia.com/first-class-functions-as-an-alternative-to-javascripts-switch-statement/

## A Useful Thing for Pre-Debugging and Interviewing: Linting

* http://jshint.com/about/
* http://jshint.com/install/

You can run it from the command line.

Also look at "JS Beautifiers."


## D3's "Reusable Chart Pattern"

* http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/

* a further refinement: Towards Reusable Charts: http://www.toptal.com/d3-js/towards-reusable-d3-js-charts

* Final Code: http://bl.ocks.org/rcmoore38/9f2908455355c0589619

(This is the style Jim Vallandingham uses in his tutorials.)

**See example using it in using_reusable_barchart.html.**

## Week 9: Stacking Chart Types, Intro to Small Multiples

## Homework Issues

Scatterplot Transitions:

* Colors by Region and labels: http://bl.ocks.org/DimsumPanda/a94f6c0c3121ad2a4f17
* Cute colors and tooltips: http://bl.ocks.org/lmelgar/raw/086115f650545013a915/

###Color by Region

This is how I expected it, but some of you did it by hand:
````
var colorScale = d3.scale.category10();
circle.attr("fill", function(d) {return colorScale(d.region);})
````

Notice that if you don't like the category() colors in D3, you can set your own, as long as you have enough in the list for your different items:

````
var color = d3.scale.ordinal().range(["lightpink", "darkgray", "lightblue"]);
color.domain(["sepsis", "malaria", "typhoid"]);
...
color(d.illness)
or color(i)
````

## Javascript Keys and Mapping

We need to get serious about mapping values.  A lot of the online examples for this week used mapping to make the data for the stacked layouts. Some of them are really terse.

Reminder about a map:

````
var array = [{a: 10, b: 20, c: 30}, {a: 14, b: 2, c: 31}];
var the_a = array.map(function (d) { return d.a;});
the_a
[10, 14]
````

Let's look at the stacked bar example in http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3886208.

The data in the CSV looks like this:

````
State,Under 5 Years,5 to 13 Years,14 to 17 Years,18 to 24 Years,25 to 44 Years,45 to 64 Years,65 Years and Over
AL,310504,552339,259034,450818,1231572,1215966,641667
AK,52083,85640,42153,74257,198724,183159,50277
AZ,515910,828669,362642,601943,1804762,1523681,862573
AR,202070,343207,157204,264160,754420,727124,407205
....
````

First we have:
````
var color = d3.scale.ordinal()
    .range(["#98abc5", "#8a89a6", "#7b6888", "#6b486b", "#a05d56", "#d0743c", "#ff8c00"]);
````

This sets up specific colors to use.

Then:

````
color.domain(d3.keys(data[0]).filter(function(key) { return key !== "State"; }));
````

What does this do?  Any guesses?

````
>data[0]
Object {State: "AL", Under 5 Years: "310504", 5 to 13 Years: "552339", 14 to 17 Years: "259034", 18 to 24 Years: "450818"â€¦}
````

Now guess...  d3.keys() returns the object attribute keys.

So the color domain:

````
>color.domain()
["Under 5 Years", "5 to 13 Years", "14 to 17 Years", "18 to 24 Years", "25 to 44 Years", "45 to 64 Years", "65 Years and Over"]
````

Then this madness, to create the format for the stacking, instead of using a stack layout:

````
data.forEach(function(d) {
    var y0 = 0;
    d.ages = color.domain().map(function(name) { return {name: name, y0: y0, y1: y0 += +d[name]}; });
    d.total = d.ages[d.ages.length - 1].y1;
  });
````

All the action is in the ages array creation.  It's the same as:

````
data.forEach(function (d) {
    var y0 = 0;
    d.ages = ["Under 5 Years", "5 to 13 Years", "14 to 17 Years", "18 to 24 Years", "25 to 44 Years", "45 to 64 Years", "65 Years and Over"].map(function(name) {
        var height = y0 + +d[name];
        var obj = { label: name,
                    y0: y0,
                    y1: height };
        y0 = height;
        return obj;
    });
    d.total = d.ages[d.ages.length - 1].y1; // last y1, which is the total height
})
````

## Area Chart

The area chart is a line chart, but filled in!  There is a new layout for it:

````
    var area = d3.svg.area()
        .x(function(d) {
            return xScale(dateFormat.parse(d.year));
        })
        .y0(height - margin.bottom)  // the bottom line!
        .y1(function(d) {
            return yScale(+d.amount); // the top line
        });
````

Example in area_plot.html.


## Stacked Area

We use the area layout and the stack function for this.

See http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch11.html#_stack_layout.

The stacker adds elements to your dataset that say what "level" an item should go in. It calculates a y0, for the y base location, and a y, which is the height from the base position.  These get added to your dataset if they weren't there already.  (Note: A lot of stacked bar examples just construct the y and y0 by hand, instead of using the stack function.)

Read: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Stack-Layout

See stacked_area_nest.html, which uses the stack layout.

## Streamgraph

The streamgraph is a minor variant on the stacked area chart!

Here's a NYT example: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/02/23/movies/20080223_REVENUE_GRAPHIC.html?_r=0

A recent news example: https://www.foreignaffairs.com/infographics/2015-10-15/china-not-rogue-donor

The only difference is:

````
var stack = d3.layout.stack()
    .offset("silhouette") // <-- instead of zero!
    .values(function(d) { return d.values; })
    .x(function(d) { return formatDate.parse(d.Year);})
    .y(function(d) { return +d.Measles; });
````

Try this in stacked_area_nest.html.

### How would we transition between them?

How would we transition between these 2 forms?  It should be easy, right?  Let's discuss.

If you want to see a tutorial on changing between these forms, see this one by Jim Vallandingham on FlowingData:

* Demo: http://projects.flowingdata.com/tut/chart_transitions_demo/
* https://flowingdata.com/2013/01/17/how-to-animate-transitions-between-multiple-charts/

## Stacked Bar Chart

Again, see this section: http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch11.html#_stack_layout.

See stacked_bar.html.

Tooltips for stacked bar charts: https://gist.github.com/mstanaland/6100713.

## Normalized Bar Chart

This is a very small variant, after you get the stacked_bar.html working.  See the // notes in the file.
Just add offset "expand" to the layout!

````
var stack = d3.layout
    .stack()
    .offset("expand");
````

You have to be sure you change your labels on the Y axis to be %'s too:

````
var yAxis = d3.svg.axis()
    .scale(yScale)
    .orient("left")
    .tickFormat(d3.format(".2s")); // for the stacked totals version
    //.tickFormat(d3.format("%")); // for the normalized version
````

### How would we transition between them?

See my example stacked_bar_transitions.html.  This includes a bunch of refactoring into functions, where there is repetition, too.  Let's discuss it.

## Bar Groups

* Grouped bar chart example: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887051

(Notice the scales for the x axis here.  There is one for the state labels, and one for each bar in the group.)

## Small Multiples in D3

Three ways:
* http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1157787
* http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/9490313 (uses 'each' and calls the drawing funct)
* http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/9490516 (I find this one strange)

* Area Charts with a UI filter: http://flowingdata.com/2012/01/05/build-interactive-time-series-charts-with-filters/ (see old D3 Code alert below)

Tutorials by Jim Vallandingham (that unfortunately use CoffeeScript):

* Tutorial with a brush: http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/08/29/multiple-area-charts-with-d3-js/


### Note: Old D3 Code Alert

If you see this stuff (e.g., in some of Flowing Data's tutorials):

````
"svg:line"
"svg:svg"
"svg:rect"
````

it's old D3 code.  We used to have to say "svg" in front of all the svg DOM elements. Not necessary anymore.

## Homework

Read this section: http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch11.html#_stack_layout. You can see how some other layouts work in that same chapter.

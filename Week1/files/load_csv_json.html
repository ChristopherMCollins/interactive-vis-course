		<p>Not much to see here; try looking in the console!</p>

		<script type="text/javascript">


			//Load in contents of CSV file
			d3.csv("test_data.csv", function(data) {

				//Now CSV contents have been transformed into
				//an array of JSON objects.
				console.log("The first file is csv...")
				//Log 'data' to the console, for verification.
				console.log(data);

			});

			d3.json("test_data.json", function(data2) {

				//Now CSV contents have been transformed into
				//an array of JSON objects.

				console.log("This file is json!")
				//Log 'data' to the console, for verification.
				console.log(data2);

			});

			// Notice that the objects look the same. d3.csv() parses rows as objects.
			// Also this is a good point to talk about scope and breakpoints.

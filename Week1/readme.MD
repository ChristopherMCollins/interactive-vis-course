##Week 1:

Lots of getting set up and review exercises.

## What This Class Covers, the General Plan...

Review repo [README](../README.md).


## Data Formatting in Excel

* Read for general good advice: http://kbroman.org/dataorg/

**Homework**: Download a data set and format in Excel for use in visualization. You will load this into javascript and send me your object output, using the model in [files/load_csv_json.html](files/load_csv_json.html).  See below for how to send me the result in a gist.


## Chrome Tools, the Console

* View Source. Let's do it. First at childmortality.org...
* Read a bit here about the console and trying stuff in it: http://jsforcats.com/#basics


## Your Local Server

Set up your servers. We need to do it now, seriously. Use this to help: https://github.com/arnicas/d3-faq#running-a-server


### Intro to HTML/CSS:

Have a look at this fun project, Tufte CSS: http://www.daveliepmann.com/tufte-css/.

**Homework:  Style [this page](files/wapo_debates_article.html) to look like the news website of your choice or like Tufte.**


### Github and Gists:

Github is how you should get and keep the course files up to date.
Make an account, if you haven't.  I recommend you clone my repo, so you can repull it as I add stuff.

* Gists how-to:  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-gists/
* Command line tool: https://github.com/mbostock/gistup

You'll be doing homework in gists.  This makes it easier for me to review and check it and find issues.  Make a directory for your files for a gist and upload those by hand from the web page, or using the command line tool gistup.

You can see all your gists by looking here - where you fill in your own user name where mine is: `https://gist.github.com/arnicas`

If you want to edit or delete it, click on the header for one from the list.

**Homework: Make your first gist with a js program that loads your data. You will need to upload the csv file, and the index.html that contains it.  Give it a description'Week1: Load data.' Send me the link.**


### Javascript Review

I sent you some stuff over the summer, and here is a list of teaching references again: https://www.javascript.com/resources.

A super simple intro with gif demos is JS For Cats: http://jsforcats.com/
You should review everything in it except for the last part on callbacks now.

We'll play with [files/console_javascript.html](files/console_javascript.html) now.

**Homework:** TODO js exercises

### Loading Data with JS/D3:

**Recommended Reading**: Loading data with D3, at http://learnjsdata.com/read_data.html.


TODO: stuff on loading data here.


**Homework**: Make your first gist with a js program that loads your data. You will need to upload the csv file, and the index.html that contains it.  Use the model in [files/load_csv_json.html](files/load_csv_json.html). Give it a description 'Week1: Load data.' Send me the link to your gist.


### Homeworks Collected Up

**Homework**:  Style [this page](files/wapo_debates_article.html) to look like the news website of your choice or like Tufte.  Don't get out of control - just headlines, byline, paragraph/body text, and images.

**Homework**: Download a UNICEF data set and format in Excel for use in visualization.  Keep a copy of the Excel file(s) for yourself, but save out a CSV file that can be loaded into javascript. You won't send me this directly (unless you can't do the next problem, which is making the gist.)

**Homework**: Make your first gist with a JS program that loads your data. You will need to upload the csv file, and the index.html that contains it.  Use the model in [files/load_csv_json.html](files/load_csv_json.html). Give it a description 'Week1: Load data.' Send me the link to your gist.

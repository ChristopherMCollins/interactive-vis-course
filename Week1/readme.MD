**Homework:  Style [this page](files/wapo_debates_article.html)
 to look like the news website of your choice or like Tufte.**


### Github and Gists:

Github is how you should get and keep the course files up to date.
Make an account, if you haven't.  I recommend you clone my repo, so you can repull it as I add stuff.

* Gists how-to:  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-gists/
* Command line tool: https://github.com/mbostock/gistup

You'll be doing homework in gists.  This makes it easier for me to review and check it and find issues.  Make a directory for your files for a gist and upload those by hand from the web page, or using the command line tool gistup.

You can see all your gists by looking here - where you fill in your own user name where mine is: `https://gist.github.com/arnicas`

If you want to edit or delete it, click on the header for one from the list.

# interactive-vis-course

Repo for U of Miami course on interactive vis by Lynn Cherny, fall 2015.


## What the Course Covers

### 1. Interactive data vis: Design Principles, Techniques, Best-Practices...

(Not actually the order we'll cover things and content subject to change)

* Making bar charts, lines charts, scatterplots with code
* Adding interactivity:
    * Rollovers
    * Tooltips
* Making interactive tables
    * Sorting
    * (Filtering)
* Animation
* Small multiples in code
* Interactive storytelling techniques
    * Steppers
    * Scrollytelling
* Linked interactive charts (brushing)
    * Exploratory vs. Explanatory "tools" and "presentations"
* APIs / AJAX and server code
* Some other useful libs (not just "raw" D3)
* Maybe maps? / class requests, overflow topics


### 2. Programming Techniques

* Javascript and useful libraries like JQuery, lowdash
* Good practices with D3
* Charting libs like High Charts, D3, libs on top of D3
* GitHub use
* Debugging how-to's


### 3. A Client Project: UNICEF: http://www.unicef.org/

* [The client brief](../APromiseRenewed_Brief_March2015.pdf)
* Their data sites: http://data.unicef.org/index.php, http://mics.unicef.org

Other resources on child mortality:

* Max Roser: http://ourworldindata.org/data/health/maternal-mortality/
* http://childmortality.org/ - UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME), of which UNICEF is a member (new data coming in September)

### 4. Evaluation

Grading based on weekly homeworks (50%) and a final project (50%) that uses many of the techniques in a storytelling project using the client data (supplemented as you like).  This is a project course - you will be making things more than you will be reading or writing, but there will be a bit of that too.

Primary emphasis is on end user experience and data honesty; secondary consideration will be good coding practices.

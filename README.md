### 4. Evaluation

Grading based on weekly homeworks (50%) and a final project (50%) that uses many of the techniques in a storytelling project using the client data (supplemented as you like).  This is a project course - you will be making things more than you will be reading or writing, but there will be a bit of that too.

Primary emphasis is on end user experience and data honesty; secondary consideration will be good coding practices.

**Extra Credit**: Grad students must do the extra credit (unless noted otherwise). Anyone else can do them for extra credit!  I'd suggest doing as many as you can.


## D3 Books and Tutorial Materials

* **Interactive Data Visualization for the Web** ("IDVW"), Scott Murrayâ€™s book: http://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book
Online version: http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345.  *This is the book I'll assign most intro D3 readings from.*

* **D3 Tips and Tricks** book by Malcolm MacLean, and http://www.d3noob.org/

* **D3.js in Action** ("D3IA"), by Elijah Meeks.  If you want ebook, order via Manning: http://www.manning.com/.  This is a more advanced book than Scott's, and covers many D3 layouts we won't get to in class.  Recommended for going further.

* **Developing a D3 Edge** by By Chris Viau, Andrew Thornton, Ger Hobbelt, and Roland Dunn: http://bleedingedgepress.com/our-books/developing-a-d3-js-edge/ (intermediate (i.e., more advanced than the ones above; covers good coding patterns too.)

* Tutorials by **Mike Bostock**, primary author of D3: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Tutorials (and some others listed).

* **Learn JS Data** from Bocoup.com: http://learnjsdata.com/index.html

* **Blocksplorer**: search for code examples in D3 blocks! http://bl.ocksplorer.org/

* Great overall tips: https://northlandia.wordpress.com/2014/10/23/ten-best-practices-for-coding-with-d3/

* Knight Center D3 Course video playlists: I'll recommend some of Scott Murray's videos as backup or weekend viewing. (They don't seem to be well-indexed on YouTube, but start [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/KnightCenterMOOC/playlists).

* **D3 Newbie FAQ**: I am working on this, and will be editing it as we encounter new ones :). https://github.com/arnicas/d3-faq


## JS Refreshers

* These books on HTML/CSS and JS/JQuery are good: http://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1440438330&sr=8-1&keywords=jon+duckett

* A short recap: http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/

* A super simple intro with gif demos is JS For Cats: http://jsforcats.com/

* Useful for your code style: **[Airbnb JS Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5)**

HW:
Make 3 D3 charts of any kind that you would like to include in your final project, all on the same page.  You can use multiple data files (using queue).  They do not have to be interactive yet (you can avoid tooltips etc until later).  It will definitely save you time if you can reuse this code in your project, so make sure you have done some investigation work.

## Intro to High Charts

Look at this project in some detail: http://datatools.urban.org/Features/wealth-inequality-charts/
Look at the source code, too.

* Install the JQuery way: http://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/installation
* Tutorial for first bar chart: http://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/your-first-chart
* Barchart example with jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/highcharts/kh5jY/
* Trellis Chart example: http://jsfiddle.net/highcharts/VqruM/
* Scatterplot example: http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.9.1/highslide-software/highcharts.com/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/scatter/
* Using data in csv's: http://www.highcharts.com/docs/working-with-data/data-module (but this is super mysterious to me - hard to tell what controls what.)

**Homework**:Make a line chart or bar chart with your data in HC using their tutorial or any of the examples. Check it in as a gist and send me the link to the gist.

## Very Simple D3 Intro:

* Read in data with d3 and verify it's there in the console: d3_load_csv_json.html
* Create <p> tags for each row of your data, using the template in the create_p_from_data.html file.

Here is the Jquery doc on append: http://api.jquery.com/append/


### Homeworks

**Homework**:Make a line chart or bar chart with your data in HC using their tutorial or any of the examples. Check it in as a gist and send me the link to the gist.

**Homework**: Read in one of your data files and verify your objects are there as expected. Prove it to me by creating <p>'s on the page using d3 in a forEach loop (you can remove the jquery approach).  Make a gist, and send me your gist link.

**Homework**: Pick a static graphic you think could be improved as an interactive.  Email me the link by Monday end of the day with subject: "Static for Redesign." We will discuss some of them in class.
